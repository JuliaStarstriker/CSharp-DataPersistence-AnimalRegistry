# Data Persistence System – Animal Registry (C#)

## Overview
A C# application designed to persist and restore animal registry data using multiple serialization strategies.

The system allows users to save and load registered animals to and from external files, ensuring data consistency between application sessions.

## Features
- Save and load application data using:
  - Plain text files
  - JSON serialization
  - XML serialization
- Structured exception handling for file operations
- Improved graphical interface for managing registry data
- Clear separation between data models and persistence logic

## Technical Focus
- File I/O in C#
- JSON and XML serialization
- Exception handling and error management
- Data persistence strategies
- Basic GUI enhancements

## Purpose
This project was built to deepen my understanding of structured data storage, serialization formats, and reliable file handling in C#.
